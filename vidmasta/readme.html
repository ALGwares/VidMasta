<b><font size="4">FAQ</font></b>
<ol>
<li><b>How do I change the folder where playing/streaming/playlist items are saved?</b> Click the &quot;Set Save Folder&quot; menu item under the &quot;Playlist&quot; menu.</li>
<li><b>How do I stop playlist items from opening automatically?</b> Un-check the &quot;Auto-Open Items&quot; menu item under the &quot;Playlist&quot; menu.</li>
<li><b>How do I search by video format?</b> Before clicking a download link, select a format from the toggle buttons at the bottom of the application window. There is no need to redo/reload the search or start a new search after selecting a different video format. Just select a different video format and then re-click the download link. The available formats are &quot;ANY&quot;, &quot;HQ&quot;, DVD, 720 HD, and 1080 HD. &quot;ANY&quot; is any video quality. &quot;HQ&quot; is high video quality (TV video quality or better). DVD is DVD video quality. 720 HD is 720p video quality. 1080 HD is 1080i/p video quality.</li>
<li><b>How do I find subtitles?</b> After performing a search, right-click a video in the results table and click the &quot;Find Subtitle&quot; menu item.</li>
<li><b>How do I disable the safety window that is shown every time I click a download link from an untrustworthy source?</b> Disable it under the &quot;Download&quot; menu by un-checking &quot;Show Link Safety Warning&quot;.</li>
<li><b>How do I get the torrent files associated with video files so that I can open them myself in a BitTorrent client?</b> Select &quot;None&quot; under the &quot;Downloader&quot; menu.</li>
<li><b>How do I search for any title name?</b> Leave the title field blank.</li>
<li><b>I want to view more results. How do I do so?</b> If there are more results that can be displayed for a particular search, then the &quot;Load More&quot; button at the bottom-right of the application window will become active. You can click this button to load more results.</li>
<li><b>Why is one of the results in bold?</b> This result is the top match returned by a search engine when performing a regular search by title name. All search preferences (e.g. minimum rating and genre) are ignored except for release dates and title type (i.e. movie or TV show).</li>
<li><b>Why is the &quot;Show PeerBlock Notification&quot; menu item disabled?</b> This feature is only available for Windows XP and higher because <a href="http://www.peerblock.com/">PeerBlock</a> only works with these operating systems.</li>
